Therefore, by default, components outside the board substrate are not copied to panel.</p> <p>Since version 1.1 this behavior, however, changes for footprints. KiKit decides whether to keep a footprint or not based on whether its origin fits inside the source area or not. For graphical items, the behavior remains the same. The reason for this change is that often footprints reach out beyond the board edge (e.g., connectors) and the users don't want to remove them. On the other hand, graphical items (e.g., texts or arrows towards the board) are purely for documentation purposes and thus, they shouldn't be included in the panelized design.</p> <p>Note that this is intended behavior; for once it is consistent with KiCAD behavior of user selection and also it allows to easily ignore surrounding comments and drawings in the board sheet (it makes no sense to have 12 same copies of the notes around the board).</p> <p>How to include the components? - specify the source area explicitly to include all your components - specify <code>tolerance: 20mm</code> for <code>source</code> (i.e., <code>--source 'tolerance: 20mm'</code>) to   enlarge the board outline bounding box.

Note, that due to the rounded corners, this panel cannot be manufactured. We will fix it later.</p> <p>Note that the <code>\\</code> in the input is there to make shell happy, so we can break our command into multiple lines.

To learn about the precise syntax of the CLI and about all options, please refer to \u2013 documentation.</p> <p>One side note \u2013 if you try it with your own board some components might be gone. KiKit respects the KiCAD component selection criteria. When you specify an input rectangle, only the components that fully fit inside the input rectangle are selected. This however take in account both name and value labels (even when they are hidden).</p> <p>When you do not specify the source are explicitly, KiKit takes the board outline bounding box as the source area. Therefore, by default, components outside the board substrate are not copied to panel.</p> <p>Note that this is intended behavior; for once it is consistent with KiCAD behavior of user selection and also it allows to easily ignore surrounding comments and drawings in the board sheet (it makes no sense to have 12 same copies of the notes around the board).</p> <p>How to include the missing components? - specify the source area explicitly to include all your components - specify <code>--source 'tolerance: 10mm'</code> to enlarge the board outline bounding box   by e.g. 10 mm. The default value is 1 mm.</p> <p>I told you that the panel above is not suitable for manufacturing. Let's see why:</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2;' \\\n    --tabs full \\\n    --cuts vcuts \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2;\" ^\n    --tabs full ^\n    --cuts vcuts ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>We specified a milling simulation post-processing. This simulates the milling operation in the fab house. As you can see, the sharp internal corners cannot be manufactured. I recommend you to use milling postprocessing always \u2013 you can easily see if your cuts are off or you have too narrow slots in your design.</p> <p>Usually, one would use full tabs only for rectangular boards. Usually, when you have rounded corners, you will use short tabs instead and add some space between the boards. So let's fix it:</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 2mm' \\\n    --tabs 'fixed; hwidth: 10mm; vwidth: 15mm' \\\n    --cuts vcuts \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 2mm\" ^\n    --tabs \"fixed; hwidth: 10mm; vwidth: 15mm\" ^\n    --cuts vcuts ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>In that way, the rounded corners can be machined. Lets' see the same example with mousebites instead:</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 2mm' \\\n    --tabs 'fixed; width: 5mm' \\\n    --cuts 'mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 2mm\" ^\n    --tabs \"fixed; width: 5mm\" ^\n    --cuts \"mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>We changed cut type to mousebites and we specified that they should be performed by 0.5mm holes with a spacing of 1 mm. You could also use inches if you want \u2013 just specify `in. Since we use mousebites, we used narrower tabs. We also specified that the cuts should be inset 0.25 mm into the board outline.

KiKit has several features that can help you. Let's start with the simple ones.</p> <p>First, you can rotate the boards in your layout. This might make not much sense for rectanglar boards, but it might save you when you have circular or oddly shaped boards:</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 0mm; rotation: 45deg;' \\\n    --tabs 'fixed; width: 3mm;' \\\n    --cuts 'mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.75mm' \\\n    --framing 'frame; width: 5mm; space: 3mm; cuts: both' \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 0mm; rotation: 45deg;\" ^\n    --tabs \"fixed; width: 3mm;\" ^\n    --cuts \"mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.75mm\" ^\n    --framing \"frame; width: 5mm; space: 3mm; cuts: both\" ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>When your board has a connector sticking one one side of the board, it makes sense to rotate the boards every other column, row or combination of both. KiKit supports this via layout option <code>alternation</code>. You should be careful about component references when rotating boards \u2013 KiCAD's references have a property \"Stay upright\" which makes them always face up (even when placed on a panel). So be sure to turn it off before panelizing. Here's an example:</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 3mm; alternation: cols;' \\\n    --tabs 'fixed; width: 3mm; vcount: 2' \\\n    --cuts 'mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm' \\\n    --framing 'frame; width: 5mm; space: 3mm; cuts: both' \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 3mm; alternation: cols;\" ^\n    --tabs \"fixed; width: 3mm; vcount: 2\" ^\n    --cuts \"mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm\" ^\n    --framing \"frame; width: 5mm; space: 3mm; cuts: both\" ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Another solution might be to not put tabs on, e.g., vertical edges of the PCB. However, in that case your panel might be weak for further assembly. You can make it more stiff by including backbones \u2013 a full piece of substrate between the panels. You can add either vertical, horizontal or both backbones. Also, similarly with frames, you can put cuts on your backbone to make depanelization of your boards easier. Enough theory, let's see an example</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 2mm; hbackbone: 5mm; hbonecut: true' \\\n    --tabs 'fixed; width: 3mm; vcount: 2; hcount: 0' \\\n    --cuts 'mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm' \\\n    --framing 'railstb; width: 5mm; space: 3mm;' \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 2mm; hbackbone: 5mm; hbonecut: true\" ^\n    --tabs \"fixed; width: 3mm; vcount: 2; hcount: 0\" ^\n    --cuts \"mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm\" ^\n    --framing \"railstb; width: 5mm; space: 3mm;\" ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Often, not all backbones are needed.

Consider the following 4\u00d74 panel with only ever other backbone:</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 4; cols: 4; space: 2mm; hbackbone: 5mm; vbackbone: 5mm; hboneskip: 1; vboneskip: 1' \\\n    --tabs 'fixed; width: 3mm; vcount: 2; hcount: 0' \\\n    --cuts 'mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm' \\\n    --framing 'railstb; width: 5mm; space: 3mm;' \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 4; cols: 4; space: 2mm; hbackbone: 5mm; vbackbone: 5mm; hboneskip: 1; vboneskip: 1\" ^\n    --tabs \"fixed; width: 3mm; vcount: 2; hcount: 0\" ^\n    --cuts \"mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm\" ^\n    --framing \"railstb; width: 5mm; space: 3mm;\" ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>The most powerful feature of KiKit regarding tab placement are tabs via annotation. Remember our test board? When you open it in Pcbnew, you can see that there are some special footprints \u2013 KiKit's annotations:</p> <p></p> <p>They specify where to place tabs. You can even specify individual tab width via text property of the symbol. How to use it? Just specify tab type to <code>annotation</code>. We also have to increase the source area tolerance, so it can capture the annotations.</p> <p>Panelization command</p> Linux/macOSWindows <pre><code>kikit panelize \\\n    --layout 'grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 5mm;' \\\n    --tabs annotation \\\n    --source 'tolerance: 15mm' \\\n    --cuts 'mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm' \\\n    --framing 'railstb; width: 5mm; space: 3mm;' \\\n    --post 'millradius: 1mm' \\\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <pre><code>kikit panelize ^\n    --layout \"grid; rows: 2; cols: 2; space: 5mm;\" ^\n    --tabs annotation ^\n    --source \"tolerance: 15mm\" ^\n    --cuts \"mousebites; drill: 0.5mm; spacing: 1mm; offset: 0.2mm; prolong: 0.5mm\" ^\n    --framing \"railstb; width: 5mm; space: 3mm;\" ^\n    --post \"millradius: 1mm\" ^\n    docs/resources/conn.kicad_pcb panel.kicad_pcb\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Well, the panel looks strange \u2013 right? That's because KiKit always constructs a half-bridges. When you specify the tabs location, you have to either ensure they match or put a piece of substrate they can reach \u2013 e.g., a backbone or a tightframe.

This substrate is appended to the resulting panel substrate. The cut is represented as a polyline of the type <code>shapely.geometry.LineString</code>.

Annotation is just a marking on the board outline that specifies \"here should be a tab of this width\". You can read the annotations from source board (there are special footprints for that), generate it manually or use some of the strategies to place the annotations (e.g., place tabs in a spacing or in given number along edges). Note that the strategies often need a properly build partition line. Once you are finished, you can render the tabs using <code>Panel.buildTabsFromAnnotations</code>. This function will merge the tab bodies and returns a list of cuts. With the list of cuts, you can further decide whether to ignore them or render them via mousebites or V-cuts. For more details on the automated process of building tabs from annotations, see understanding tabs.</p> <p>The document understanding tabs also explains what is a partition line and how it is used.

The partition line is not a single one for the whole panel, but it is stored separately for each appended board as the annotations are rendered independently for each appended board.</p> <p>Also note that you can use the partition line as guide when placing features (e.g., adding a holes on backbone, etc.).</p>"},{"location":"panelization/scripting/#appending-boards","title":"Appending Boards","text":"<p>The simples approach to adding boards to a panel is using <code>Panel.appendBoard</code>. This places a board in the panel and also, it renames the nets such that they are panel-wise unique. This is necessary to pass DRC. You can specify the renaming pattern if you want. The substrate of the board is added the panel substrate, but it is also stored separately in <code>Panel.substrates</code> as the shape of the original board can be used to generate the automatic tabs and also it is used to copper-fill the non-board areas of the panel. You can also use these substrates to build your custom features.</p> <p>If you make single-board panels, you can use the function <code>Panel.makeGrid</code> to quickly place the boards in a grid. The function returns the list of individual substrates. You can use the substrates e.g., to build custom tabs or other features.</p>"},{"location":"panelization/tabs/","title":"How are tabs in KiKit created?","text":"<p>When you place multiple PCB into the panel, KiKit expects you to generate a so-called partition line for each individual PCB. Partition line is an oriented (poly)line that partitions the free space between the PCBs. It gives you the information \"this part of the free space belongs to this PCB substrate and this PCB is responsible for placing tabs in that space\". So for a regular input the partition line can look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>For more complicated input, it can look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>Note several facts: - partition line is used for backbone generator - partition line is not generated automatically, it is up to the user to   generate it. KiKit offers <code>Panel.buildPartitionLineFromBB</code> that builds the   partition line based on bounding boxes. If you need possibly a more   complicated lines, you have to implement them by yourself. - partition line is used for deciding if an annotation yields a tab or not - if   the tab does not hit the partition line, it is not created. - when we create partition line from bounding boxes, we include \"ghost   substrates\" representing the framing, that will be added in the future.</p> <p>When KiKit generates a tab, it generates it based on tab origin, direction and optionally the partition line. When a tab is successfully generated, it consists out of two components - a piece of a substrate (which will be later appended to the panel) and a cut-line.</p> <p>So assume we have the following PCB outline (the PCB is below the line, there is a free space above the line):</p> <p></p> <p>Then you specify your tab origin and its direction:</p> <p></p> <p>This is your input (e.g., via an annotation). Now KiKit does its job; it shoots two rays <code>tabWidth</code> apart and looks for the intersection with existing substrates. Note that if the ray starts within the PCB, no intersection will be found.</p> <p></p> <p>Once we have the intersections, we can easily generate the tab substrate and the cut:</p> <p></p> <p>Note that if we specify a partition line, than we shoot new rays in the opposite direction and try to hit the line. If we manage to do so, we get a tab. Otherwise, no tab is generated.</p> <p></p> <p>This is the basic algorithm for generating tabs. Well, we might also call them \"half tabs\". KiKit usually generates the half tabs around the board bounding box and then expects that two half tabs in the middle of the panel will merge into a single one. Also, KiKit first generates all the tabs and then merges them in one step to the board substrate. The cut is just a polyline which is in later steps either rendered as a V-cut or via mousebites.</p>"}]}
