# Examples

This document will show you several examples of KiKit CLI for panelization. Note
that this is **not an exhaustive description** of everything that KiKit can do,
nor proper documentation. For further details, please refer to:

- [installation guide](installation.md)
- [description of all panelization options](panelizeCli.md)
- [more detail about KiKit's algorithm for tab creation](understandingTabs.md)
- [reference for the Python interface](panelization.md)

We will show everything on a single board located in
`doc/resources/conn.kicad_pcb`. The board looks like this when rendered via
PcbDraw:

We specified that we want 2x2 panel, no space between board and separate them by
V-cuts. We also specified that we want to build full tabs (although no tabs are
visible in this example). This is ,however, essential - if we omitted tabs, no
cuts between the boards would be performed. Note, that due to the rounded
corners, this panel cannot be manufactured. We will fix it later.

Note that the `\` in the input is there to make shell happy, so we can break our
command into multiple lines. Also note that there are single quotes around the
key-value pair - again, to make shell happy and to interpret a string with
spaces as a single option.

Also note that KiKit accepts all options in categories (e.g., `layout`, `tabs`,
`cuts`, ...). You can specify the parameters as a semicolon-separated key-value
list. To learn about the precise syntax of the CLI and about all options, please
refer to - [documentation](panelizeCli.md).

One side note - if you try it with your own board some components might be gone.
KiKit respects the KiCAD component selection criteria. When you specify an input
rectangle, only the components that **fully fit** inside the input rectangle are
selected. This however take in account **both name and value labels** (even when
they are hidden).

When you do not specify the source are explicitly, KiKit takes the board outline
bounding box as the source area. Therefore, by default, components outside the
board substrate are not copied to panel.

Note that this is intended behavior; for once it is consistent with KiCAD
behavior of user selection and also it allows to easily ignore surrounding
comments and drawings in the board sheet (it makes no sense to have 12 same
copies of the notes around the board).

How to include the missing components?
- specify the source area explicitly to include all your components
- specify `--source 'tolerance: 10mm'` to enlarge the board outline bounding box
  by e.g. 10 mm. The default value is 5 mm.

I told you that the panel above is not suitable for manufacturing. Let's see why:

# Advanced features & layouts

It is possible that you have some critical features you want to avoid with tabs.
KiKit has several features that can help you. Let's start with the simple ones.

First, you can rotate the boards in your layout. This might make not much sense
for rectanglar boards, but it might save you when you have circular or oddly
shaped boards:

        ["--post", "millradius: 1mm"],
        [SRC]])

print("""
When your board has a connector sticking one one side of the board, it makes
sense to rotate the boards every other column, row or combination of both. KiKit
supports this via layout option `alternation`. You should be careful about
component references when rotating boards - KiCAD's references have a property
"Stay upright" which makes them always face up (even when placed on a panel). So
be sure to turn it off before panelizing. Here's an example:

print("""
Another solution might be to not put tabs on, e.g., vertical edges of the PCB.
However, in that case your panel might be weak for further assembly. You can
make it more stiff by including backbones - a full piece of substrate between
the panels. Note that adding a backbone does not extend space between boards -
that's up to you. You can add either vertical, horizontal or both backbones.
Also, similarly with frames, you can put cuts on your backbone to make
depanelization of your boards easier. Enough theory, let's see an example

The most powerful feature of KiKit regarding tab placement are tabs via
annotation. Remember our test board? When you open it in Pcbnew, you can see
that there are some special footprints - KiKit's annotations:

They specify where to place tabs. You can even specify individual tab width via
text property of the symbol. How to use it? Just specify tab style to
`annotation`. We also have to increase the source area tolerance, so it can
capture the annotations.

If you need something special; e.g., custom placement of tooling holes, multiple
texts, etc. KiKit has you covered.

The CLI interface allows you to run a custom script over the final panel. The
script can use KiKit Python interface to modify it. For the sake of simplicity,
let's add a hole in the middle of the frame. Therefore, we write the following
script:

```.py
from kikit.units import mm
from pcbnew import wxPoint

def kikitPostprocess(panel, arg):
    minx, miny, maxx, maxy = panel.panelBBox()
    position = wxPoint((minx + maxx) / 2, miny + 2 * mm)
    panel.addNPTHole(position, 3 * mm)

You can learn more about available functions from the comment in the source code
or in [documentation](panelization.md).

If you implement a feature that your fab house requires (e.g., new tooling hole
style), consider submitting a pull request for KiKit instead. I believe the
others will benefit from it.

# Managing presets

The last section of this document is dedicated to management of presets. You can
read the specification in the [documentation for CLI](panelizeCli.md). Here I
would like to focus on practical examples.

As you should know from the documentation, the panelization preset is divided
into sections; e. g., `layout`, `tabs`, etc. The key-value parameters in these
sections can be specified via JSON files. In KiKit, you can specify these files
via `-p` option:

```
kikit panelize -p myPreset.json -p :<builtInPreset> <other parameters>
```

The parameters in the later specified presets override the parameters in the
previously specified presets. This allows you to define a named piece-wise
presets. Therefore, you can prepare various presets for mousebites - e.g.,
`fineMousebites.json` and `coarseMousebites.json`:

```.js
// fineMousebites.json
{
    "cuts": {
        "style": "mousebites",
        "drill": "0.5mm",
        "spacing": "0.9mm",
        "offset": "0.25mm"
    }
}

// coarseMousebites.json
{
    "cuts": {
        "style": "mousebites",
        "drill": "0.3mm",
        "spacing": "0.2mm",
        "offset": "0.15mm"
    }
}
```

Then you can specify your panelization commands easily via:

```
kikit panelize -p fineMousebites.json <otheroptions>
```

Therefore, you can build a custom library of commonly used-options; e.g., per
fabrication house. KiKit offers some built-in styles - see
[`panelizePresets`](../kikit/resources/panelizePresets). Note that the built-in
preset `default.json` is always used as a base and it specifies conservative
default values so you can only override the options relevant for you.

To give you an example - with KiKit, you will no longer have to remember what
diameter of tooling holes JLC PCB requires, just use:

```
kikit panelize -p :jlcTooling <otheroptions>
```
