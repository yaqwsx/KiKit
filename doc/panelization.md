# Panelization

When you want to panelize a board, you are expected to load the `kikit.panelize`
module and create an instance of the `Panel` class.

All units are in the internal KiCAD units (1 nm). You can use predefined
constants to convert from/to them:

```.py
from kikit.units import *

l = 1 * mm    # 1 mm
l = 42 * inch # 42 inches
l = 15 * cm   # 15 cm
a = 90 * deg  # 90Â°
a = 1 * rad   # 1 radian
```

You can also use functions `fromMm(mm)` and
`toMm(kiUnits)` to convert to/from them if you like them more. You are
also encouraged to use the functions and objects the native KiCAD Python API
offers, e.g.: wxPoint(args)`, `wxPointMM(mmx, mmy)`, `wxRect(args)`, `wxRectMM(x, y, wx, wy).


## Basic Concepts

The `kikit.panelize.Panel` class holds a panel under construction. Basically it
is `pcbnew.BOARD` without outlines. The outlines are held separately as
`shapely.MultiPolygon` so we can easily merge pieces of a substrate, add cuts
and export it back to `pcbnew.BOARD`. This is all handled by the class
`kikit.substrate.Substrate`.

## Tabs

There are two ways to create tabs: generate a piece of a substrate by hand, or
use tab generator.

To generate a piece of a substrate, create a shapely.Polygon. Then add the piece
of substrate via `panelize.Panel.appendSubstrate`. This method also accepts a
`wxRect` for convenience.

The tab generator is available via `panelize.Panel.boardSubstrate.tab`. This
method takes an origin point, direction, and tab width. It tries to build a tab
by extruding a tab with the given width in the given direction and stops when it
reaches an existing substrate. It returns a tuple - the tab substrate and a
piece of the outline of the original board, which was removed by the tab. Then
add the piece of a substrate via `panelize.Panel.appendSubstrate`. This design
choice was made as batch adding of substrates is more efficient. Therefore, you
are advised to first generate all the tabs and then append them to the board.

You read more about the algorithms for generating tabs in a separate document
[understanding tabs](understandingTabs.md).

## Cuts

All methods constructing panels do not create cuts directly, instead, they
return them. This allows the users to decided how to perform the cuts - e.g.,
mouse bites, V-Cuts, silk-screen...

The cuts are represented by `shapely.LineString`. The string is oriented - a
positive side of the string should face the inner side of the board. This is
important when, e.g., offsetting mouse bites.

To perform the cuts, see methods of the `panelize.Panel` class below.

## Source Area And Tolerance

When placing a board, you might specify source area -- a rectangle from which
the components are extracted. If no source area is specified, the smallest
bounding box of all Edge.Cuts is taken.

Only components that fully fit inside source area are copied to the panel. To
include components sticking out of the board outline, you can specify tolerance
-- a distance by which the source area is expanded when copying components.


#### `appendBoard`
```
appendBoard(self, filename, destination, sourceArea=None, origin=Origin.Center, 
            rotationAngle=0, shrink=False, tolerance=0, bufferOutline=1000, 
            netRenamer=None, refRenamer=None, inheritDrc=True, 
            interpretAnnotations=True)
```

## Panel class

This class has the following relevant members:
- `board` - `pcbnew.BOARD` of the panel. Does not contain any edges.
- `substrates` - `kikit.substrate.Substrate` - individual substrates appended
  via `None`. You can use them to get the
  original outline (and e.g., generate tabs accroding to it).
- `boardSubstrate` - `kikit.substrate.Substrate` of the whole panel.
- `backboneLines` - a list of lines representing backbone candidates. Read more
  about it in [understanding tabs](understandingTabs.md).

there is enough space on the board/frame/rail to place the feature.

The offsets are measured from the outer edges of the substrate.

#### `addCornerFillets`
```
addCornerFillets(self, radius)
```

addCornerTooling(self, holeCount, horizontalOffset, verticalOffset, diameter, 
                 paste=False)
```
Add up to 4 tooling holes to the top-left, top-right, bottom-left and
bottom-right corner of the board (in this order). This function expects
there is enough space on the board/frame/rail to place the feature.

The offsets are measured from the outer edges of the substrate.

#### `addFiducial`
```
addFiducial(self, position, copperDiameter, openingDiameter, bottom=False)
```

with given copperDiameter and openingDiameter. By setting bottom to True, the fiducial
is placed on bottom side.

        thickness=300000, hJustify=EDA_TEXT_HJUSTIFY_T.GR_TEXT_HJUSTIFY_CENTER, 
        vJustify=EDA_TEXT_VJUSTIFY_T.GR_TEXT_VJUSTIFY_CENTER, 
        layer=Layer.F_SilkS)

            rotationAngle=0, shrink=False, tolerance=0, bufferOutline=1000, 
            netRenamer=None, refRenamer=None, inheritDrc=True, 
            interpretAnnotations=True)
```
Appends a board to the panel.

The sourceArea (wxRect) of the board specified by filename is extracted
and placed at destination (wxPoint). The source area (wxRect) can be
auto detected if it is not provided. Only board items which fit entirely
into the source area are selected. You can also specify rotation. Both
translation and rotation origin are specified by origin. Origin
specifies which point of the sourceArea is used for translation and
rotation (origin it is placed to destination). It is possible to specify
coarse source area and automatically shrink it if shrink is True.
Tolerance enlarges (even shrinked) source area - useful for inclusion of
filled zones which can reach out of the board edges or footprints that
extend outside the board outline, like connectors.

You can also specify functions which will rename the net and ref names.
By default, nets are renamed to "Board_{n}-{orig}", refs are unchanged.
The renamers are given board seq number and original name.

You can also decide whether you would like to inherit design rules from
this boards or not.

Returns bounding box (wxRect) of the extracted area placed at the
destination and the extracted substrate of the board.

#### `appendSubstrate`

    same as in the original, set this to "{orig}"

tolerance - if no sourceArea is specified, the distance by which the selection

## Substrate class

This class represents a pice of substrate (with no components). Basically it is
just a relatively thin wrapper around shapely polygons. On top of that, it keeps
a partition line for the substrate. Read more about partition lines in
[understanding tabs](understandingTabs.md).

(2D point) and tries to penetrate existing substrate in direction (a 2D
vector). The tab is constructed with given width. If the substrate is
not penetrated within maxHeight, exception is raised.

When partitionLine is specified, tha tab is extended to the opposite
side - limited by the partition line. Note that if tab cannot span
towards the partition line, then the the tab is not created - it returns
a tuple (None, None).

adding of geometry is more efficient.

#### `translate`
```
translate(self, vec)
```
