# Panelization

When you want to panelize a board, you are expected to load the `kikit.panelize`
module and create an instance of the `Panel` class.

All units are in the internal KiCAD units (1 nm). You can use predefined
constants to convert from/to them:

```.py
from kikit.units import *

l = 1 * mm    # 1 mm
l = 42 * inch # 42 inches
l = 15 * cm   # 15 cm
a = 90 * deg  # 90°
a = 1 * rad   # 1 radian
```

You can also use functions `fromMm(mm)` and
`toMm(kiUnits)` to convert to/from them if you like them more. You are
also encouraged to use the functions and objects the native KiCAD Python API
offers, e.g.: VECTOR2I(args)`, `BOX2I(args).


## Basic Concepts

The `kikit.panelize.Panel` class holds a panel under construction. Basically it
is `pcbnew.BOARD` without outlines. The outlines are held separately as
`shapely.MultiPolygon` so we can easily merge pieces of a substrate, add cuts
and export it back to `pcbnew.BOARD`. This is all handled by the class
`kikit.substrate.Substrate`.

## Tabs

There are two ways to create tabs: generate a piece of a substrate by hand, or
use tab generator.

To generate a piece of a substrate, create a shapely.Polygon. Then add the piece
of substrate via `panelize.Panel.appendSubstrate`. This method also accepts a
`BOX2I` for convenience.

The tab generator is available via `panelize.Panel.boardSubstrate.tab`. This
method takes an origin point, direction, and tab width. It tries to build a tab
by extruding a tab with the given width in the given direction and stops when it
reaches an existing substrate. It returns a tuple - the tab substrate and a
piece of the outline of the original board, which was removed by the tab. Then
add the piece of a substrate via `panelize.Panel.appendSubstrate`. This design
choice was made as batch adding of substrates is more efficient. Therefore, you
are advised to first generate all the tabs and then append them to the board.

You read more about the algorithms for generating tabs in a separate document
[understanding tabs](understandingTabs.md).

## Cuts

All methods constructing panels do not create cuts directly, instead, they
return them. This allows the users to decided how to perform the cuts - e.g.,
mouse bites, V-Cuts, silk-screen...

The cuts are represented by `shapely.LineString`. The string is oriented - a
positive side of the string should face the inner side of the board. This is
important when, e.g., offsetting mouse bites.

To perform the cuts, see methods of the `panelize.Panel` class below.

## Source Area And Tolerance

When placing a board, you might specify source area -- a rectangle from which
the components are extracted. If no source area is specified, the smallest
bounding box of all Edge.Cuts is taken.

Only components that fully fit inside source area are copied to the panel. To
include components sticking out of the board outline, you can specify tolerance
-- a distance by which the source area is expanded when copying components.


#### `appendBoard`
```
appendBoard(self, filename, destination, sourceArea=None, origin=Origin.Center, 
            rotationAngle=<pcbnew.EDA_ANGLE; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'EDA_ANGLE *' at 0x7f354e4f7de0> >, 
            shrink=False, tolerance=0, bufferOutline=1000, netRenamer=None, 
            refRenamer=None, inheritDrc=True, interpretAnnotations=True, 
            bakeText=False)
```

## Panel class

This class has the following relevant members:
- `board` - `pcbnew.BOARD` of the panel. Does not contain any edges.
- `substrates` - `kikit.substrate.Substrate` - individual substrates appended
  via `None`. You can use them to get the
  original outline (and e.g., generate tabs accroding to it).
- `boardSubstrate` - `kikit.substrate.Substrate` of the whole panel.
- `backboneLines` - a list of lines representing backbone candidates. Read more
  about it in [understanding tabs](understandingTabs.md).


#### `addCornerChamfers`
```
addCornerChamfers(self, horizontalSize, verticalSize=None)
```
Add chamfers to the panel frame. The chamfer is specified as size in
horizontal and vertical direction. If you specify only the horizontal
one, the chamfering will be 45°.

#### `addFiducial`
```
addFiducial(self, position, copperDiameter, openingDiameter, bottom=False)
```
Add fiducial, i.e round copper pad with solder mask opening to the position (`VECTOR2I`),

is placed on bottom side.

#### `addKeepout`
```
addKeepout(self, area, noTracks=True, noVias=True, noCopper=True)
```
Add a keepout area to all copper layers. Area is a shapely
polygon. Return the keepout area.

#### `addLine`
```
addLine(self, start, end, thickness, layer)
```
Add a line to the panel based on starting and ending point

#### `addMillFillets`
```

        thickness=300000, hJustify=EDA_TEXT_HJUSTIFY_T.GR_TEXT_HJUSTIFY_CENTER, 
        vJustify=EDA_TEXT_VJUSTIFY_T.GR_TEXT_VJUSTIFY_CENTER, 
        layer=Layer.F_SilkS)
```

#### `appendBoard`
```
appendBoard(self, filename, destination, sourceArea=None, origin=Origin.Center, 
            rotationAngle=<pcbnew.EDA_ANGLE; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'EDA_ANGLE *' at 0x7f354e4f7de0> >, 
            shrink=False, tolerance=0, bufferOutline=1000, netRenamer=None, 
            refRenamer=None, inheritDrc=True, interpretAnnotations=True, 
            bakeText=False)
```
Appends a board to the panel.

The sourceArea (BOX2I) of the board specified by filename is extracted
and placed at destination (VECTOR2I). The source area (BOX2I) can be
auto detected if it is not provided. Only board items which fit entirely
into the source area are selected. You can also specify rotation. Both
translation and rotation origin are specified by origin. Origin
specifies which point of the sourceArea is used for translation and
rotation (origin it is placed to destination). It is possible to specify
coarse source area and automatically shrink it if shrink is True.
Tolerance enlarges (even shrinked) source area - useful for inclusion of
filled zones which can reach out of the board edges or footprints that
extend outside the board outline, like connectors.

You can also specify functions which will rename the net and ref names.
By default, nets are renamed to "Board_{n}-{orig}", refs are unchanged.
The renamers are given board seq number and original name.

You can also decide whether you would like to inherit design rules from
this boards or not.

Similarly, you can substitute variables in the text via bakeText.

Returns bounding box (BOX2I) of the extracted area placed at the
destination and the extracted substrate of the board.

#### `appendSubstrate`

#### `buildPartitionLineFromBB`
```
buildPartitionLineFromBB(self, boundarySubstrates=[], safeMargin=0)
```
Builds partition & backbone line from bounding boxes of the substrates.
You can optionally pass extra substrates (e.g., for frame). Without
these extra substrates no partition line would be generated on the side
where the boundary is, therefore, there won't be any tabs.

#### `buildTabAnnotationsCorners`

buildTabAnnotationsCorners(self, width)
```
Add tab annotations to the corners of the individual substrates.

#### `buildTabAnnotationsFixed`
```
buildTabAnnotationsFixed(self, hcount, vcount, hwidth, vwidth, minDistance,

tabs in horizontal and vertical direction. You can specify individual
width in each direction.

If the edge is short for the specified number of tabs with given minimal
spacing, the count is reduced.

You can also specify ghost substrates (for the future framing).

#### `buildTabAnnotationsSpacing`
```
buildTabAnnotationsSpacing(self, spacing, hwidth, vwidth, ghostSubstrates)
```
Add tab annotations for the individual substrates based on their spacing.

You can also specify ghost substrates (for the future framing).

```
Fill given layers with copper on unused areas of the panel (frame, rails
and tabs). You can specify the clearance, if it should be hatched
(default is solid) or shape the strokes of hatched pattern.

         netRenamePattern=Board_{n}-{orig}, refRenamePattern=Board_{n}-{orig}, 
         tolerance=0, bakeText=False)
```
Place the given board in a grid pattern with given spacing. The board
position of the gride is guided via placer. The nets and references are
renamed according to the patterns.

Parameters:

boardfile - the path to the filename of the board to be added

sourceArea - the region within the file specified to be selected (see
also tolerance, below)
    set to None to automatically calculate the board area from the board
    file with the given tolerance

rows - the number of boards to place in the vertical direction

cols - the number of boards to place in the horizontal direction

destination - the center coordinates of the first board in the grid (for
example, VECTOR2I(100 * mm,50 * mm))

rotation - the rotation angle to be applied to the source board before
placing it

placer - the placement rules for boards. The builtin classes are:
    BasicGridPosition - places each board in its original orientation
    OddEvenColumnPosition - every second column has the boards rotated
    by 180 degrees OddEvenRowPosition - every second row has the boards
    rotated by 180 degrees OddEvenRowsColumnsPosition - every second row
    and column has the boards rotated by 180 degrees

netRenamePattern - the pattern according to which the net names are
transformed
    The default pattern is "Board_{n}-{orig}" which gives each board its
    own instance of its nets, i.e. GND becomes Board_0-GND for the first
    board , and Board_1-GND for the second board etc

refRenamePattern - the pattern according to which the reference
designators are transformed
    The default pattern is "Board_{n}-{orig}" which gives each board its
    own instance of its reference designators, so R1 becomes Board_0-R1
    for the first board, Board_1-R1 for the second board etc. To keep
    references the same as in the original, set this to "{orig}"

tolerance - if no sourceArea is specified, the distance by which the
selection
    area for the board should extend outside the board edge. If you have
    any objects that are on or outside the board edge, make sure this is
    big enough to include them. Such objects often include zone outlines
    and connectors.

bakeText - substitute variables in text elements

last operation, none of the operations have to be placement-aware.

## Substrate class

This class represents a pice of substrate (with no components). Basically it is
just a relatively thin wrapper around shapely polygons. On top of that, it keeps
a partition line for the substrate. Read more about partition lines in
[understanding tabs](understandingTabs.md).

#### `tab`
```
tab(self, origin, direction, width, partitionLine=None, maxHeight=50000000, 
    fillet=0)
```
Create a tab for the substrate. The tab starts at the specified origin
(2D point) and tries to penetrate existing substrate in direction (a 2D
vector). The tab is constructed with given width. If the substrate is
not penetrated within maxHeight, exception is raised.

When partitionLine is specified, the tab is extended to the opposite
side - limited by the partition line. Note that if tab cannot span
towards the partition line, then the tab is not created - it returns a
tuple (None, None).

If a fillet is specified, it allows you to add fillet to the tab of
specified radius.

Returns a pair tab and cut outline. Add the tab it via union - batch
adding of geometry is more efficient.

#### `translate`
```
translate(self, vec)
```
Translate substrate by vec

#### `union`
```
union(self, other)
```
Appends a substrate, polygon or list of polygons. If there is a common
